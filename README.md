# Simple Volunteering Tracker
Recently, I began to volunteer at my local library. That inspired me to build this app, which can track volunteer hours so you can "cash out" when you need them. After you volunteer, you simply write the location you volunteered at, the hours you put in, and the date you did this. Once you submit, the data is put into a MS SQL Server database hosted on Azure. You can also delete data. The frontend is built with Vite, TailwindCSS and React. The backend is built with Express.JS
